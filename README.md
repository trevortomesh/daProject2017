This is my readme. There are many like it but this one is mine.

What outcry have you uttered about my person, you oafish brute? I shall cordially remind you that I was the best scholar in my
law class in Oxford, and I have been involved in several frivolous tea parties and courtroom disputes, and I have over 300
boxes of Earl Gray. I am proficient in the Simian school of diplomacy and I am the top linguist in my book club. Know that you
resemble nothing in my eyes save for yet another uncultured mind. I will hasten your undisputed expiration from the world with
grace and finesse. The thought that you can retreat after jesting of such matters over the internet is laughable. As of this
moment, I am telephoning a mutual friend to negotiate a swift and sure rebuttal to your argument so I would implore you to
prepare yourself for the upcoming verbal deluge. The deluge that will no doubt saturate your life with discomfort. You are
well and truly wrong, my good sir. My abilities of travel are unmatched, and I can recite over 700 lines from Shakespeare, and
that is just from Hamlet. The amount of knowledge that I have accrued is vast, and I shall use it to firmly state my authority
on such matters, you rapscallion. Truly, I wish you had some semblance of knowledge on the matter you have brought up and its
repercussions. Alas, you did not, and now you will suffer a fate most dire, you plebeian. I shall defecate concentrated
dislike upon you and you shall struggle to survive in its waters. Pistols at dawn, old boy.
